<h1>BAKERecipes - About</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! 
  Welcome to my website. I am Xinru, the creator and publisher of BAKERecipes. 
I am a huge fan of Food, especially cakes and breads. Inspired by my creative mother and my fabulous grandma who cooks the most delicious food, I frequently step into the kitchen to make the meals of the day. My 2 lovely sisters would be there to taste and comment. Being an avid reader, I enjoy exploring different recipes I find on library books. 
With all my experience thus far, I would like to share the different recipes I use.</p>
